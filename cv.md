My solution of 6 kyu Kata from [CODEWARS](https://www.codewars.com/) "Find The Parity Outlier"

*You are given an array (which will have a length of at least 3, but could be very large) containing integers. The array is either entirely comprised of odd integers or entirely comprised of even integers except for a single integer N. Write a method that takes the array as an argument and returns this "outlier" N.*

```
const findOutlier = integers => {
    let evens = integers.filter(a => a % 2 === 0)
    let odds = integers.filter(a => a % 2 !== 0)
    return evens.length > odds.length ? odds[0] : evens[0]
}
```
## Languages
- **Russian** - Native
- **English** - According to the test at https://www.efset.org/:  
*Your score indicates that your level of English is in the range of B1 INTERMEDIATE to B2 UPPER INTERMEDIATE, according to the guidelines set by the Common European Framework of Reference (CEFR).
You understand the main points of what you hear and read in English, and you are beginning to follow abstract topics with relative confidence.*
